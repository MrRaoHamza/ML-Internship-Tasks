# ML Internship Tasks  

This repository contains four machine learning tasks completed during my internship. Each task involves data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using different algorithms.

## ðŸ“Œ Tasks Overview  

### **Task 1 â€“ Email Spam Classification**  
This task focuses on building a **machine learning model** to classify emails as *Spam* or *Not Spam*.  
- Performed data preprocessing (cleaning text, removing stopwords, stemming/lemmatization).  
- Converted text into numerical features using **TF-IDF / CountVectorizer**.  
- Trained models such as **NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Random Forest, and MLP**.  
- Evaluated performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

### **Task 2 â€“ Iris Flower Classification**  
This task uses the **Iris dataset** (a classic dataset in ML).  
- Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.  
- Classified flowers into **Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**.  
- Applied models like **Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression**.  
- Visualized data distributions and decision boundaries.

### **Task 3 â€“ Titanic Survival Prediction**  
This task predicts whether a passenger survived the **Titanic disaster** based on passenger data.  
- Features: age, gender, class, family size, fare, etc.  
- Preprocessed missing values and categorical features.  
- Trained **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting** models.  
- Achieved insights on which factors influenced survival most.

### **Task 4 â€“ House Price Prediction**  
This task builds a regression model to predict **house prices**.  
- Dataset includes features like number of rooms, area, location, year built, etc.  
- Applied **feature scaling and encoding** for categorical variables.  
- Implemented **Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and MLP Regressor**.  
- Evaluated performance using **RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score**.
